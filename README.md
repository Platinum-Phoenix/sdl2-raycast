# SDL2 Raycasting Demo

This was originally a port of [my HTML5 canvas version here](https://github.com/andrew-lim/html5-raycast).
But there are many more features now including floor/ceiling texture mapping, sprites and projectiles.

You can see a [video of it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlM9mbUYROM).

Download the [Windows demo here](https://github.com/andrew-lim/sdl2-raycast/releases/).
Note: Use E to open doors and spacebar to shoot.

You will need SDL2 and SDL2_mixer.
